This code is based on the Atmel Corporation Manchester
Coding Basics Application Note.

Quotes from the application note:

"Manchester coding states that there will always be a transition of the message signal 
at the mid-point of the data bit frame. 
What occurs at the bit edges depends on the state of the previous bit frame and
does not always produce a transition. A logical “1” is defined as a mid-point transition
from low to high and a “0” is a mid-point transition from high to low.

We use Timing Based Manchester Decode.
In this approach we will capture the time between each transition coming from the demodulation
circuit."

Timer 2 is used with a ATMega328. Timer 1 is used for a ATtiny85.

This code gives a basic data rate as 1000 bits/s. In manchester encoding we send 1 0 for a data bit 0.
We send 0 1 for a data bit 1. This ensures an average over time of a fixed DC level in the TX/RX.
This is required by the ASK RF link system to ensure its correct operation.
The actual data rate is then 500 bits/s.

Timer 2 in the ATMega328 and Timer 1 in a ATtiny85 is used to find the time between 
each transition coming from the demodulation circuit.
Their setup is for normal count. No connections. No interupts.
The divide ratio is /256 with 16 Mhz the 328 and /128 for the 85 with a 8 Mhz clock.
This gives 16 usec per count. For a normal pulse this is 62.5 counts.
With an error allowance of 22.5 usec we get the following:
