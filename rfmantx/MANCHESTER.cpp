This code is based on the Atmel Corporation Manchester
Coding Basics Application Note.

Quotes from the application note:

"Manchester coding states that there will always be a transition of the message signal 
at the mid-point of the data bit frame. 
What occurs at the bit edges depends on the state of the previous bit frame and
does not always produce a transition. A logical “1” is defined as a mid-point transition
from low to high and a “0” is a mid-point transition from high to low.

We use Timing Based Manchester Decode.
In this approach we will capture the time between each transition coming from the demodulation
circuit."

Timer 2 is used with a ATMega328. Timer 1 is used for a ATtiny85.

This code gives a basic data rate as 1000 bits/s. In manchester encoding we send 1 0 for a data bit 0.
We send 0 1 for a data bit 1. This ensures an average over time of a fixed DC level in the TX/RX.
This is required by the ASK RF link system to ensure its correct operation.
The actual data rate is then 500 bits/s.

/*
The 433.92 Mhz receivers have AGC, if no signal is present the gain will be set 
to its highest level.

In this condition it will switch high to low at random intervals due to input noise.
A CRO connected to the data line looks like 433.92 is full of transmissions.

Any ASK transmission method must first sent a capture signal of 101010........
When the receiver has adjusted its AGC to the required level for the transmisssion
the actual data transmission can occur.

We send 14 0's 1010...    It takes 1 to 3 10's for the receiver to adjust to 
the transmit level.

The receiver waits until we have at least 10 10's and then a start pulse 01.
The receiver is then operating correctly and we have locked onto the transmission.
